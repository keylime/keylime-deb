== Keylime debian packager ==

A first cut at building a debian packager for keylime. It's based on
dh-python, and therefore in turn relies on pip3.

-- TODOs --

* Have the copyright file checked and approved.

* Get basic buy-in on the dh-python approach.

* Have the dependencies tested by as many people as can be.

* Python nose tests are currently disabled. They need to be enabled so
  unit tests can run before packaging.
